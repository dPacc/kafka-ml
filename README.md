# Machine Learning on Streaming Data

Robust machine learning on streaming data using Kafka and Tensorflow-IO

## Overviewï¿¼

This tutorial focuses on streaming data from a **Kafka** cluster into a**tf.data.Dataset** which is then used in conjunction with **tf.keras** for training and inference.

### Kafka

Kafka is primarily a **distributed event-streaming platform** which provides scalable and fault-tolerant streaming data across data pipelines. It is an essential technical component of a plethora of major enterprises where mission-critical data delivery is a primary requirement.

### TensorFlow I/O

It is a collection of file systems and file formats that are not available in TensorFlow's built-in support.
It provides useful extra Dataset, streaming, and file system extensions, and is maintained by TensorFlow SIG-IO.
